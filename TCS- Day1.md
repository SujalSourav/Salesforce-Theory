🌍 What is Salesforce?

Salesforce is a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform.
In simple words:

It helps businesses manage their customers, sales, and data in one place.

You don’t need to install software on your computer; everything runs on the cloud.

It allows both developers (backend) and users (frontend) to work easily with data.

✅ Advantages of Salesforce

Cloud-based → No installation needed.

Easy customization → Create objects, fields, and apps without coding.

Scalable → Works for small startups and big companies.

Secure → Role-based access and profiles.

Integration → Connect with many other apps.

📦 What is an Object in Salesforce?

In Salesforce, an Object is like a table in a database.

It stores data in the form of records (rows).

Each object has fields (columns).

📝 Types of Objects

Standard Objects → Already provided by Salesforce (like Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity).

Custom Objects → Created by us as per our needs.

🛠️ How to Create an Object

You can create a custom object using Setup in Salesforce.

Steps to Create an Object

Go to Setup (⚙️ icon in the top-right).

Click Object Manager → It stores and manages all objects.

Click New Object.

Fill in details:

Label (Name)

Plural Label

Description

Click Next.

Choose which Profiles should have access to this object.

Click Next.

Choose which Applications should display this object.

Click Save.

🔹 At this point, your object is created but has no fields by default.

🔑 What are Fields?

Fields are like columns in a table.

They store specific pieces of data (like Name, Age, Email).

🏗️ How to Create Fields in an Object
Steps to Add a Field

Go to Setup → Object Manager.

Select the object you created.

From the left panel, click Fields & Relationships.

Click New.

Click Save.

📱 How to Use Your Object & Fields

Click the App Launcher (9 dots) on the top-left.

Open the Application where you added your object.

Select your Custom Object.

Click New → Fill in the fields you created → Save.

✅ You’ll now see your data saved in Salesforce!

📚 Example Flow (Summary)

Object = Table

Fields = Columns

Record = Row

👉 First create the Object → Then create Fields → Then enter Records using App Launcher.

🎯 Final Notes

Salesforce = CRM + Cloud + Customization.

Objects are the foundation.

Always decide:

Who (Profile) can access the Object/Field.

Which Application will display it
